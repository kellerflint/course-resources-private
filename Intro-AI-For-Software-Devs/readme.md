This is the course I developed for Green River's 450 class for their SDEV program.

The objective is to introduce students with high programming and low data experience to concepts of AI. At the end students should have a basic understanding of the landscape of AI, where 

Main topics are
- Basics of python, pandas and jupyter notebooks
- Basics of traditional ML, learn how to very simple eda / data cleaning and create linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees and random forests. Learn basics of model performance metrics and evaluation. Understand over and under fitting
- Basics concepts of neural networks and how they work. Basic implementation of simple neural networks. Learn about a few common types of network architectures (FFNNs, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers). Touch on computer vision and reenfocement learning, implement a basic model for each.
- Using generative AI as a tool for programming and productivity. How to work with it effectively
- Using AI in application development (AI enabled application development). Starting with simple ChatGPT clone since they have web experience and moving on to using langchain and learning about agents, RAG, prompt engineering, different types of LLMs, etc.

Secondary topics are
- Discussion of bias and ethics in AI
- Discussion of opportunities in and future with AI
- Discussion of careers in data and AI
